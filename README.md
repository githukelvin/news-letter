### Newsletter Sign-up Form with Success Message

This code represents a simple newsletter sign-up form with a success message. It is designed to capture user email addresses for subscribing to a monthly newsletter. Here's an overview of the different components and functionality of the code:

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the code consists of the following elements:

### CSS and Fonts

The code includes a CSS file, main.css, which is linked in the <head> section. This file is responsible for styling the components and layout of the page. Additionally, custom fonts are preloaded using the <link> tags for Roboto-Bold.woff2 and Roboto-Regular.woff2 files.

### JavaScript

The code includes a JavaScript file, main.js, which is linked at the end of the HTML body. The purpose and functionality of this JavaScript file are not provided in the code snippet.

The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the sign-up form by validating the email address entered and displaying appropriate messages or actions based on the validity of the email. Additionally, it allows the user to dismiss the success message and reset the form for further submissions.
